The mission of the Fred Hutch Data Science Lab (the Office of the Chief Data Officer) is to ensure an effective data ecosystem by developing a modern, well documented, well implemented, overall data strategy that evolves with the needs and capabilities of those leveraging data regardless of “where they live” from the clinic to the research groups.
