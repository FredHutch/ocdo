- Have you found that sharing your analysis with others is difficult?
- Are you tired of saying “Well, it works on my computer”?

You may be in need of this workshop! Learn about how to maintain your analysis and software projects so that they will still be runnable months later by managing the R and Python packages that they are dependent on.

We will cover two package management systems: `uv` for Python, and `renv` for R."""
