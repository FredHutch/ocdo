answer = "The class is open to members of the Cancer Consortium including Fred Hutch, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "Can I take more than one class at once?"
answer = "You can, but we recommend you don’t mix R and Python at the same time, because it can be confusing to switch between the two."

question = "Can I take this class more than once?"
answer = "You can sign up more than once, but be aware that there is tyspically a waitlist. We will prioritize students who have not taken the class. If there is room you are welcome to take it again."
