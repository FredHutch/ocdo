Have a question not seen here? Please email us at data@fredhutch.org\nGeneral Class Questions\n\nCan I attend Online or in Person?\n\nWe support in-person and online attendance (through Teams) of the courses.\nWe have a number of learners who learn online, and switch between online and in-person. We do have a limited number of in-person seats, so we do try to account for that in course registration. Due to the popularity of the badging program, we also limit registration so our instructors can live sane lives.\nOur preference is that you try to attend the courses synchronously, as a lot of good questions are brought up by other learners that can help in your learning, and we find that learning together socially can accelerate your learning process.\nWhere are the course invites?\n\nWhen registration is finalized for a course, we will be sending out course invites via Outlook.\nThe course is full or I missed an opportunity to register! What do I do?\n\nIf the course is full, you will be redirected to a waiting list. If a slot becomes available, we will contact you.\nWe will contact you when the next time the course is given and give you preferential registration for the course.\nI want to take the Intermediate course and I've taken the Intro Course. How does that work?\n\nIf you have enrolled for the previous intro courses (Intro Python/R), you will have preferential registration for the following courses.\nI don't have the course prerequisite at the Hutch, but I know the material - can I enroll in the course?\n\nPlease email us at data@fredhutch.org so we can understand your level of knowledge. Based on that discussion, we will allow enrollment for the course.\nWhat is the difference between a Course and a Workshop?\n\nCourses are multiple sessions focused on Data Science with both in-class and homework exercises. They have a badge associated with them.\nWorkshops are single sessions meant to focus on smaller topics. Some workshops are part of a sequence (such as Scalable Computing or Reproducible Research, but you can take the workshops separately.\nR and Python\n\nWhich should I learn first, R or Python?\n\nFor new Data Science learners, this can seem like a difficult decision. Here's our advice:\nThe first thing you should ask is: what language is your group using? If they focus on R, then start there. If they focus on Python, then focus on Python.\nIf you are learning on your own, they both are strong languages. If you are focusing on data analysis and statistical analysis, R can be easier to understand. For machine learning, Python is stronger in terms of machine learning support. There is the ability to work with both languages.\nThe R Community is very welcoming of beginners, but the Python Community is definitely catching up.\nUltimately, what matters is your own tenacity and curiosity. Once you have the fundamentals of one language mastered, then you can pick up the other one.\nCan I take both R and Python courses at the same time?\n\nWe do not recommend taking both Python and R courses at the same time, as they are just different enough that it will frustrate your learning.\nBadging Program\n\nWhat is the Badging Program?\n\nWe have started the Credly badging program as a way to show your mastery of data science concepts. Once you receive a badge, you can share in in various places, such as LinkedIn.\nIt is not an accredited program (Fred Hutch is not an accredited university), but many learners find it useful because it keeps them accountable for learning.\nRequirements for each course vary, but it is usually completing an number of assignments.\nWe currently offer badges for the following courses:\n\nBash for Bioinformatics\nIntro to SQL\nIntro to R\nIntermediate R\nBioconductor for Genomics\nIntro to Python\nIntermediate Python\nMachine Learning for Python\n\nCommunity\n\nHow do I keep in touch with what the Data Science Lab is Offering?\n\nWe highly recommend that you sign up for our newsletter! We post about upcoming courses, workshops, and related events such as Data Deep Dives, Co-Working, and Learning Communities.\nWhat is co-working?\n\nSee here.\nWhat are Learning Communities?\n\nSee here.\nI'm confused about DaSL vs. OCDO\n\nYou're not alone! As a rule of thumb:\n\nThe Data Science Lab (DaSL) is focused on outreach, training, and community.\nOffice of the Chief Data Officer (OCDO) is our official organization within Fred Hutch. DaSL operates as the outreach arm for OCDO.\n\n","path":null},{"url":"https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/classes-workshops/","title":"Class Catalog","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/community/","title":"Community","description":null,"body":"Ways to Connect\n\nWe offer multiple ways of engaging with others in the Fred Hutch Data Science community:\n\nCo-working\nLearning Communities\nDatathons\n\nLearning Community Values\n\nAt the Data Science Lab, we are strong believers in the power of social learning. Our values are:\n\nResearch doesn’t need to be lonely. We learn and work best with our peers.\nThe ways that data impacts our work at Fred Hutch are wide and varied. There is no one right way, but there are best practices we can aspire to.\nSharing knowledge in public is important. Together, our collective knowledge can help us all improve how we work. Everyone knows something that could help someone else in our community.\nAsking questions is a way of taking care of our peers. They often may have the same questions, but might be reluctant to ask them.\n\nCommunity Participation Guidelines\n\nAll DaSL Community events adhere to the&nbsp;DaSL Community Participation Guidelines. This is to ensure a safe space for all.\nCo-working\n\nOne of our core values is that Data Science doesn't need to be lonely. We are often working in isolation, as lone data scientists.\nWhat is the solution? Co-working.\nCo-working is working in the same space with other people, whether online or in-person. Interesting conversations and collaborations can happen when you are working with others. For example, we ran a single-cell learning community because of the interest generated by co-working participants.\nDuring the quarter, we will offer co-working on Mondays, usually around 12 - 1 PM. Feel free to drop in and work with us! For more info, please sign up for the newsletter.\nLearning Communities\n\nLearning communities are informal groups of people doing projects, classwork, or anything else to master the skills they need for their work. Community members can work on their own, share what they’re doing, get constructive feedback, ask for advice, or whatever else they need.\nLearning communities are focused on specific topics and are hosted by members of OCDO. They are discussion oriented and are for learners at all levels.\nPast Learning Communities have focused on learning single cell analysis and data management.\nIf you are interested, sign up for the newsletter.\nDatathons\n\nA Datathon is a day in which folks get together to explore a dataset together, practice what we have learned in data science creatively, and share it with each other! Past Datathons have looked at spatial data, health survey data, and climate data.\nThey usually are at the end of the quarter on a Friday from 11am-2pm PT. Lunch will be provided.\n","path":null},{"url":"https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/courses/","title":"Class Schedule","description":null,"body":"","path":null},{"url":"https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl/participation-guidelines/","title":"Participation Guidelines","description":null,"body":"(Adapted from Mozilla Participation Guidelines)\nDaSL Community Studios are a safe space to learn, teach, and ask questions of each other. In order to make DaSL Community Studios welcome to all, we provide these Participation Guidelines. Please note that these guidelines are a supplement to (and not a replacement of) Fred Hutch’s Standards of Conduct while participating in Community Studios related activities.\nThese guidelines aim to support a community where all people should feel safe to participate, introduce new ideas and inspire others, regardless of:\n\nAcademic Background\nBackground\nFamily status\nGender\nGender identity or expression\nMarital status\nSex\nSexual orientation\nNative language\nAge\nAbility\nNeurodiversity\nRace and/or ethnicity\nCaste\nNational origin\nSocioeconomic status\nReligion\nGeographic location\nAny other dimension of diversity\n\nOpenness, collaboration and participation are core values of our work together. We gain strength from diversity and actively seek participation from those who enhance it. These guidelines exist to enable diverse individuals and groups to interact and collaborate to mutual advantage. This document outlines both expected and prohibited behavior. We welcome any suggestions and changes to make these guidelines more inclusive for everyone, by emailing us at data@fredhutch.org.\nWhen and How to Use These Guidelines\n\nThese guidelines outline our behavior expectations as participants of community studios in all community studio activities, both offline and online. Your participation is contingent upon following these guidelines in community studios related activities, including but not limited to:\n\nParticipating in Community Studio sessions (online or in person)\nParticipation in Community Studio Slack channels\nDaSL Community Studio Co-working sessions\nAny projects resulting from Community Studios Participation\n\nExpected Behavior\n\nThe following behaviors are expected of all participants:\nBe Collaborative\n\nWhen providing feedback, try to use the “Yes, And…” rule when making suggestions - try to build up and synthesize rather than tear down and analyze. Only provide the type of feedback that a participant requested and not give unwanted feedback. Honor and appreciate questions (”that’s a great question!”) that come from others with different areas of knowledge. Give space to those who may talk less in a session to contribute to discussions. Give credit where credit is due, especially if collaborators helped you shape a project or a publication, using citations, mentions, or in chat.\nBe Respectful\n\nValue each other’s ideas, styles and viewpoints. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor manners. Be open to different possibilities and to being wrong. Be respectful in all interactions and communications, especially when debating the merits of different options. Be aware that other’s area of knowledge may be different than yours. Be aware of your impact and how intense interactions may be affecting people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for your impact and your mistakes – if someone says they have been harmed through your words or actions, listen carefully, apologize sincerely, and correct the behavior going forward.\nBe aware of the impact of words such as “just” or “simply” as demotivating to others.\nBe Inclusive\n\nSeek diverse perspectives. Diversity of views and of people on teams powers innovation, even if it is not always comfortable. Encourage all voices. Help new perspectives be heard and listen actively. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, it is especially important to step back and encourage other voices to join in. Be aware of how much time is taken up by dominant members of the group. Provide alternative ways to contribute or participate when possible.\nBe inclusive of everyone in an interaction, respecting and facilitating people’s participation whether they are:\n\nRemote (on video or phone)\nNot native language speakers\nComing from a different culture\nUsing pronouns other than “he” or “she”\nLiving in a different time zone\nFacing other challenges to participate\n\nThink about how you might facilitate alternative ways to contribute or participate. If you find yourself dominating a discussion, step back. Make way for other voices and listen actively to them.\nUnderstand Different Perspectives\n\nOur goal should not be to “win” every disagreement or argument. A more productive goal is to be open to ideas that make our own ideas better. Strive to be an example for inclusive thinking. “Winning” is when different perspectives make our work richer and stronger.\nAppreciate and Accommodate Our Similarities and Differences\n\nWe come from many cultures and backgrounds at Fred Hutch. Cultural differences can encompass everything from official religious observances to personal habits to clothing. Be respectful of people with different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own biases, prejudices and discriminatory practices. Realize that your level of understanding/practice may not be other’s, and eliminate your assumptions when possible. Think of others’ needs from their point of view. Use preferred titles (including pronouns) and the appropriate tone of voice. Respect people’s right to privacy and confidentiality. Be open to learning from and educating others as well as educating yourself; it is unrealistic to expect participants to know the cultural practices of every ethnic and cultural group, but everyone needs to recognize one’s native culture is only part of positive interactions.\nLead by Example\n\nBy matching your actions with your words, you become a person others want to follow. Your actions influence others to behave and respond in ways that are valuable and appropriate for our organizational outcomes. Design your community and your work for inclusion. Hold yourself and others accountable for inclusive behaviors.\nBehavior That Will Not Be Tolerated\n\nThe following behaviors are considered to be unacceptable under these guidelines.\nViolence and Threats of Violence\n\nViolence and threats of violence are not acceptable - online or offline. This includes incitement of violence toward any individual, including encouraging a person to commit self-harm. This also includes posting or threatening to post other people’s personally identifying information (“doxxing”) online.\nPersonal Attacks\n\nConflicts will inevitably arise, but frustration should never turn into a personal attack. It is not okay to insult, demean or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not acceptable. It is important to speak directly when we disagree and when we think we need to improve, but such discussions must be conducted respectfully and professionally, remaining focused on the issue at hand.\nDerogatory Language\n\nHurtful or harmful language related to:\n\nBackground\nFamily status\nGender\nGender identity or expression\nMarital status\nSex\nSexual orientation\nNative language\nAge\nAbility\nRace and/or ethnicity\nCaste\nNeurodiversity\nNational origin\nSocioeconomic status\nReligion\nGeographic location\nOther attributes\n\nis not acceptable. This includes deliberately referring to someone by a gender that they do not identify with, and/or questioning the legitimacy of an individual’s gender identity. If you’re unsure if a word is derogatory, don’t use it. This also includes repeated subtle and/or indirect discrimination; when asked to stop, stop the behavior in question.\nUnwelcome Sexual Attention or Physical Contact\n\nUnwelcome sexual attention or unwelcome physical contact is not acceptable. This includes sexualized comments, jokes or imagery in interactions, communications or presentation materials, as well as inappropriate touching, groping, or sexual advances. Additionally, touching a person without permission, including sensitive areas such as their hair, pregnant stomach, mobility device (wheelchair, scooter, etc) or tattoos is unacceptable. This includes physically blocking or intimidating another person. Physical contact or simulated physical contact (such as emojis like “kiss”) without affirmative consent is not acceptable. The sharing or distribution of sexualized images or text is unacceptable.\nDisruptive Behavior\n\nSustained disruption of events, forums, or meetings, including talks and presentations, will not be tolerated. This includes:\n\n‘Talking over’ or ‘heckling’ speakers.\nMinimizing contributions from others (”That’s dumb, use this instead”)\nOtherwise influencing crowd actions that cause hostility in the session.\n\nInfluencing Unacceptable Behavior\n\nWe will treat influencing or leading such activities the same way we treat the activities themselves, and thus the same consequences apply.\nConsequences of Unacceptable Behavior\n\nThese consequences build on the Standards of Conduct at Fred Hutch. When in doubt, refer to those policies, including the related reporting procedures. The consequences below apply to DaSL Community Studio related events in particular.\nBad behavior from any participant, including those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Intentional efforts to exclude people (except as part of a consequence of the guidelines or other official action) from community studio activities are not acceptable and will be dealt with appropriately.\nReports of harassment/discrimination will be promptly and thoroughly investigated by the people responsible for the safety of the space, event or activity. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the situation. In addition, any participants who abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of these guidelines and subject to the same consequences. False reporting, especially to retaliate or exclude, will not be accepted or tolerated.\nAnyone being asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. Violation of these guidelines can result in anyone being asked to leave an event or online space, either temporarily or for the duration of the event, or being banned from participation in spaces, or future events and activities in perpetuity.\nReporting\n\nIf you believe you’re experiencing unacceptable behavior that will not be tolerated as outlined above, please use data@fredhutch.org&nbsp;to report it to DaSL leadership.\nAfter receiving a concise description of your situation, we will review and determine the next steps. In addition to conducting any investigation, they can provide a range of resources, from a private consultation to other community resources.\n\nQuestions:&nbsp;data@fredhutch.org\n\nPlease also report to us if you observe a potentially dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of these guidelines, even if the situation is not happening to you.\nIf you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process.\nLicense and Attribution\n\nThis set of guidelines is distributed under a&nbsp;Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike license.\nThese guidelines have been adapted with modifications from Mozilla’s Community Participation Guidelines, the&nbsp;Ubuntu Code of Conduct, Mozilla’s&nbsp;View Source Conference Code of Conduct, and the&nbsp;Rust Language Code of Conduct, which are based on Stumptown Syndicate’s&nbsp;Citizen Code of Conduct.
