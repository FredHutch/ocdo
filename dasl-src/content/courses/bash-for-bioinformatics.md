- Have you needed to align a folder of FASTA files and not know how to do it?
- Do you want to automate an R or Python script you wrote to work on a bunch of files?
- Do you want to do all of this on a high performance cluster (HPC)?

If so, this course is for you! We will learn enough bash scripting to do useful things on the Fred Hutch cluster and automate the boring parts."""
