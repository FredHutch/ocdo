Our collaborative data science training group creates a variety of data science training resources including live classes at Fred Hutch, trainer-lead learning communities and online resources.  You can find links to our [training resources on our Training page.](https://hutchdatascience.org/training/)


## Community-Based Training

Training at the Data Science Lab consists of more than courses and workshops. We learn best when we learn with others, so we provide social opportunities to learn together. There are opportunities to Learn Skills through courses, to Experience skills in Learning Communities, and to practice our skills together with codeathons.

Please note that all courses, workshops, and learning community sessions adhere to the [DaSL Event Participation Guidelines](pages/participation.qmd). 



## Self Directed Training

We also offer self directed material in the form of guides and documentation for computational and data oriented topics in the SciWiki.
