This emerging group aims to create a collaborative network across Fred Hutch to provide additional support for data governance generally. This involves partnering with Fred Hutch departments like legal, compliance, IT and others to develop a comprehensive network of communication and documentation related to data governance, policy, procedures, and best practices. 

We support investigators navigating resources at Fred Hutch regarding data policy and governance processes surrounding topics such as data use agreements, software licensing, data oriented tech-transfer issues and guidance regarding IRB oversight of data use. We also support various ongoing projects and efforts to promote data stewardship and literacy in the clinical and research community.

## Data Governance Efforts

Projects we're working on:

- Documentation of data access policies and procedures for Fred Hutch clinical patient data
- Developing an honest broker process for review of clinical data requests for research
- Coordination of clinical data agreements with data access and use with our Consortium partners (UW and Seattle Children's).
- Navigation support for data related compliance, privacy and oversight questions
- Developing policy, best practices and guidance for use of AI and regulated research datasets
- Providing resources for improved data stewardship and data management approaches
