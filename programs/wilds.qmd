We prioritize open source resources for tooling to support our clinical and 
research communities at Fred Hutch.  Our emerging resources are housed in 
our [WILDS GitHub organization](https://github.com/getwilds) described on our homepage for [WILDS](https://getwilds.org/). This org is where you can 
get Workflows Integrating Large Data set and Software. 

Our work in populating the WILDS aims to address the following goals:

- highlighting, maturing, and enabling translational implementation of open 
source research software for biomedical research that is developed at Fred 
Hutch by our group or Fred Hutch staff
- development of supportive tools for a range of end user expertise levels that 
make the management, processing and presentation of diverse types of 
translational data sets (medical record, laboratory, sequencing, imaging, etc) 
less of a burden
- reduce the requirement for individuals to have specialized expertise in 
software, computing and technology who want to advance their science or 
clinical care to be more data driven and leveraging advanced technologies and 
analytics
- build the bridges that span the “data chasms” that exist in clinical care and 
research that prevent us from creating a continuous loop between research data 
product development and clinical implementation
- focus on the specific bridges of most utility to making Fred Hutch staff able 
to do things with data today that will be standard practice in the clinic and 
in research in 10 years
- integrate principles from across disciplines related to data science such as 
policy and governance, data management, reproducible analysis, data sharing and 
open science into the very tools we create rather than assuming those practices 
are up to the user to understand and implement separately

## Workflow Development Program

The Research Informatics team offers free, collaborative support to help Fred Hutch researchers develop [WDL (Workflow Description Language)](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/datascience/wdl_workflows/) workflows for scalable, reproducible computational analyses. In exchange, completed workflows are contributed to the open-source [WILDS WDL Library](https://sciwiki.fredhutch.org/datascience/wilds_wdl/) ([GitHub](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-wdl-library)) for the broader research community.

Through this program, we:

- Collaborate with researchers to convert existing scripts, pipelines, or tool combinations into WDL workflows
- Provide workflows optimized for Fred Hutch HPC and/or cloud environments
- Publish all workflows to the [WILDS WDL Library](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-wdl-library) under open-source licenses
- Provide documentation on how to run and adapt workflows

### What to Expect

1. **Submit a request** using our [intake form](https://forms.office.com/r/TXmB0qaTTa)
2. **Initial meeting** -- We'll schedule a [Data House Call](dhc.qmd) to discuss your project, assess fit, and scope the work
3. **Development** -- The WILDS team writes the WDL workflow
4. **Testing & feedback** -- You test the workflow with your data and provide feedback
5. **Publication** -- The workflow is added to the [WILDS WDL Library](https://github.com/getwilds/wilds-wdl-library) with appropriate attribution

### Is This a Good Fit?

This program works best when:

- You have existing scripts or a published pipeline you want to scale up
- Your workflow has broad applicability to other researchers
- You're willing to have the final product shared publicly
- You can commit time to testing and providing feedback
