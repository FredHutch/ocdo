main_subtitle = """This course will introduce you to the basic data structures and genomic data analysis in Bioconductor. Specifically, we will focus on the basics of RNAseq analysis, including differential expression, annotation, and gene set analysis. We will also focus on loading data and metadata into data structures such as `SummarizedExperiment`. By the end of this course, you should be familiar with a basic RNAseq analysis workflow utilizing RNAseq count data. 

Please note that this course requires the Intro to R course as a prerequisite, or the equivalent course. Please note that this course does not cover RNAseq workflows such as MultiQC and alignment."""

question = "Can I take more than one class at once?"
answer = "You can, but we recommend you don’t mix R and Python at the same time, because it can be confusing to switch between the two."

question = "Can I take this class more than once?"
answer = "You can sign up more than once, but be aware that there is tyspically a waitlist. We will prioritize students who have not taken the class. If there is room you are welcome to take it again."
