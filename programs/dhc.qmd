Our **Data House Calls** are a chance to leverage OCDO staff's expertise to help you get where you want to go with your data science skills, data management plans and execution, computing needs and beyond. Data House Calls are meant to be topical, focused on solving specific problems or discussing specific topics and function sometimes as a navigation tool to refer people to where they need to go even if we don’t have all the answers.  

Typically 1-2 DaSL staff members are available for any given topic with an eye toward keeping availability high to ensure a fairly rapid timeframe between when people need the help and when they can sign up for it and get it.
