We aim to connect the right technology or data science partners with research and clinical use cases at Fred Hutch, collaborating with Business Development and Philanthropy to enhance research capabilities and drive innovation. Our staff cultivates external relationships with AI, technology and data science partners and identify opportunities for philanthropic investment, industry sponsorships, and technology partnerships to advance research and clinical care.
