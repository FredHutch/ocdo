In part 1, we’ll talk about basic table presentation principles and guidelines on how to effectively organize your data, especially using cognitive psychology to group data and make the tables easier to understand.

In part 2, we’ll learn about the packages that enable you to present data more effectively: the gt package (for R) and the GreatTables package (for Python). Both of these allow you to format and export publication quality tables in a wide variety of formats, including Word, LaTeX, and HTML.
