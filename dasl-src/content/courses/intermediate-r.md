You will learn how to make use of complex data structures, use custom functions built by other R users, creating your own functions, and how to iterate repeated tasks that scales naturally. You will also learn how to clean messy data to a Tidy form for analysis, and conduct an end-to-end data science workflow."""

objective = "**Apply** tools for Tidying data to get a messy dataset into analysis-ready form, via data recoding, data transformations, and data subsetting. "

[[extra.learning_objectives]]
objective = "**Describe** the data science workflow and how a data analysis project fits into the workflow."

[[extra.learning_objectives]]
objective = "**Create** simple, custom functions that can be reused throughout an analysis."

[[extra.learning_objectives]]
objective = "**Understand** the need for using iteration in programming to reduce repeated code and implement simple repeated tasks."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "How often is this class taught?"
answer = "This class is offered once a year (currently winter quarter). Check the schedule to see when it will next be offered."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "Can I work through the materials without taking the class?"
answer = "Yes, you can access the course materials on your own any time."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "Can I get a badge without taking the class?"
answer = "You need to complete the live class to get a badge."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "Can I take the class if I’m not an employee at Fred Hutch?"
answer = "The class is open to members of the Cancer Consortium including Fred Hutch, the University of Washington, and Seattle Children’s Hospital."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "Can I take more than one class at once?"
answer = "You can, but we recommend you don’t mix R and Python at the same time, because it can be confusing to switch between the two."

[[extra.faq]]
question = "Can I take this class more than once?"
answer = "You can sign up more than once, but be aware that there is tyspically a waitlist. We will prioritize students who have not taken the class. If there is room you are welcome to take it again."
