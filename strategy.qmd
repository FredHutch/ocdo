Our group provides data strategy and data governance support across the entire Fred Hutch data ecosystem, from the clinic to the research labs. We aim to create a compliant, scalable, and accessible data ecosystem that benefits all personnel through collaborative projects and programs. By enabling staff to leverage data and technology, our work advances the understanding of disease, therapeutics, and patient outcomes.  

## Guiding Principles

Our approach to supporting Fred Hutch staff focuses on the following guiding principles. 


#### Advance a Unified Data Strategy Through Data and Technology Collaborations 

Close collaboration between data and technology teams empowers our staff to lead and innovate in clinical care and translational research.  By working together to shape and implement a cohesive data strategy, we drive progress in clinical care, research, and operations, adapting to emerging needs and opportunities in data science and technology.



#### Prioritize Data Democratization and Ethical Data Stewardship

We are committed to data democratization - making it accessible, understandable, and actionable for everyone in our organization, regardless of technical expertise. Through intuitive tools and a culture of ethical data stewardship, we ensure data serves as a driving force for innovation and responsible decision-making across healthcare and research.

#### Build, Foster and Empower Data Communities of Practice

We are dedicated to building and supporting data-related communities of practice that span the Fred Hutch, from the clinic to the research labs. By providing shared platforms, tools, open documentation, training and peer-to-peer programs, we empower our teams to collaborate, share knowledge, and establish best practices that drive innovation in their fields.

## Data Science Partnerships
We aim to connect the right technology or data science partners with research and clinical use cases at Fred Hutch, collaborating with Business Development and Philanthropy to enhance research capabilities and drive innovation. Our staff cultivates external relationships with AI, technology and data science partners and identify opportunities for philanthropic investment, industry sponsorships, and technology partnerships to advance research and clinical care.



## Connect with us

If you'd like to let us know what issues you’re seeing, desired data capabilities that would advance your work, or to get updates on current status of our efforts around strategy please email [data@fredhutch.org](mailto:data@fredhutch.org). 


### Data House Calls
You can connect with us through our [Data House Calls](programs/dhc.qmd) and these specific Data House Call types to schedule a quick, 20 min discussion with us.  

-  [General Data House Call](https://calendly.com/data-house-calls/misc): For high level or broad data related topics with Amy Paguirigan, Deputy CDO
- [Translational Data House Call ](https://calendly.com/data-house-calls/cards): For a translational data and technology oriented discussion (e.g, CARDS, UWM governance collaborations) with Amy Paguirigan, Deputy CDO
- [Partnerships Data House Call](https://calendly.com/data-house-calls/partnerships): For information about Data Science Partnerships with Brian Bot, Director of AI and Data Science Partnerships

### Data Noon Community Calls

We support the Fred Hutch’s diverse data community by providing visibility and communications around ongoing data-related projects through our regular "Data Noon" community calls and newsletters.  We present the current status of identified data programs and projects via three series:  

- Data Strategy and Governance
- Patient Data 
- Research Data 

Please request to be added to the relevant Data Noon Community Call or to receive the associated newsletter by emailing [dataproductmanagement@fredhutch.org](mailto:dataproductmanagement@fredhutch.org). 



## Our Strategic Priorities
Since our inception in the summer of 2022, these priorities have evolved to reflect the high-level needs voiced by the Fred Hutch data community. They guide our work to maximize impact on the daily data experiences of Fred Hutch staff.  They are informed by the Fred Hutch Strategic Priorities and aim to identify opportunities that make progress toward our collective goals and mitigate data related risk (updated in Spring of 2025).

### **Data Partnerships and Strategy**

The merger making Fred Hutch a hybrid clinical and research institute brings together diverse skills, perspectives, and goals that accelerate innovation. To realize this potential, we nucleate institution-wide efforts to build a unified, ethical, and scalable data ecosystem through iterative, use-case-driven, and transparent processes.  Our leadership works across clinical and research domains to shape data and AI strategy, connect Fred Hutch with technology and data science partners, and foster communities of practice.

### **Data Governance**

We work to advance ethical, compliant, and responsible data use across Fred Hutch through cross-departmental support through data related policies, processes, and staff education that strengthen data stewardship in clinical care and research. We help staff navigate data access, sharing, licensing, and regulatory requirements, and we support emerging areas such as AI governance. We also lead cross-institution data governance initiatives supporting Cancer Consortium data sharing to enable adult oncology initiatives. Through this work, we ensure that high-quality, timely data can be leveraged to drive discovery while protecting patient privacy and institutional integrity.  

### **Translational Data Science and AI**

Fred Hutch’s hybrid role in clinical care and research gives us the opportunity to connect real-world patient data with laboratory discoveries with data and technology to enable a learning healthcare system.  We work to develop scalable translational data products — including large scale analysis workflows, statistical and machine learning models and multimodal data packages —  that span both the research and clinical domains, enhancing integration of data across Fred Hutch. As the use of AI systems rapidly expands, we are also focused on enabling their ethical, effective adoption through governance processes, education, and technical consultation.  

### **Translational Tools and Data Products**

Our team is building the data and technology foundations needed to power the next generation of translational data science. Through our efforts, we connect data engineering, data science, data governance and product development to create a secure, scalable, well-governed platform that bridges clinical care and research.  At the heart of this work is our Clinical and Research Data System (CARDS) — the emerging backbone of Fred Hutch’s translational data ecosystem. CARDS integrates multimodal clinical data to enable new capabilities across clinical trials, precision oncology, data science, and AI innovation. Our vision is to democratize access to high-quality, actionable data, and to deliver scalable data products that empower researchers and clinicians to securely explore, analyze, and accelerate life-saving discoveries.

### **Training, Documentation and Communities of Practice**

Our goal is to create a data environment where the entire Fred Hutch community is equipped to leverage data and technology to drive breakthroughs in research, improve patient care, and transform healthcare delivery.  Our efforts are designed to empower every member of the organization with the skills, knowledge, and support they need to harness the full potential of data science, AI, and technology in their everyday work.  Through a wide range of training programs — including live courses, workshops, and collaborative learning opportunities — we aim to foster accessible opportunities for continuous learning and development for all staff.
