Data Storytelling is the art of communicating your message about data to others. There are effective techniques (decluttering, annotating, and highlighting) that you can use to make your visualizations more accessible and communicative.

This is a software-agnostic workshop, focusing on essential principles that can be applied to any visualization software. Hands-on examples will be demonstrated in both R and Python."""
