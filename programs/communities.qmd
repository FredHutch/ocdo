DaSL Learning Communities are events designed to catalyze community and conversations around shared workflows and interests in biomedical data science topics. They are spaces where folks from across Fred Hutch and the Cancer Consortium can meet to see new methods and ways of working, to share their own insights into their work, and to get constructive feedback about how they could improve their computing work.

In Learning Communities we hold closely the belief that we are all on the same team. Even though you may be the only computing or data science practitioner in your working group, we are committed to creating an environment where all feel welcome to share their experiences. This way, despite the challenges we face in our work, we can all learn from each other and improve our skills.

DaSL employees will moderate, attend, and occasionally present on topics in the Learning Communities.
