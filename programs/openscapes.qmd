We are proud to partner with [Openscapes](https://www.openscapes.org/) to bring the Openscapes Champions Cohort Program to Fred Hutch. 

[Openscapes Champions](https://openscapes.github.io/series/program-summary) is a data science mentorship program designed for scientific research groups. The Champions program helps people reimagine data analysis & stewardship as a collaborative effort, develop modern skills that are of immediate value to the team, and cultivate collaborative and inclusive research communities.

::: {.callout-important}
We are currently accepting applications for the Spring 2025 Champions Cohort! See below for how to apply.
:::

Do you or your team...

- Need to use new data science tools but don’t know where to start?
- Work in isolation, but want to collaborate more often?
- Want to make your science more reproducible?
- Want to work alongside other teams to implement new practices for data analysis & stewardship?

If yes, the Openscapes Champions may be a good fit!

### How does it work?

Openscapes Champions is a two-month program that is led remotely, with video 
calls designed for active participation to ignite sustainable change within 
data groups – within the realities of busy schedules and varying expertise 
and needs. 

The Champions Program operates with cohorts of 5 to 7 groups, 
with 2 to 5 individuals per group (24-35 people total per cohort). Importantly, 
group leads (faculty, lecturers, program managers, etc.) and members 
(students, analysts, lab managers, etc.) participate together so that:

1. everyone sees and values what is possible with open data science; 
2. leads enable members to invest time to learn skills and develop shared workflows; 
3. members have guidance, agency, and support to incorporate concepts into 
their work; and 
4. everyone becomes Champions for open data science, 
strengthening the community of practice within the research group and beyond.

If you are the ["lonely data scientist"](https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-01-07-solving-the-lonely-data-scientist-problem/) in your group, we still encourage you to apply. You will be grouped with similar-minded people as a group. 

### Spring 2025 Champions Cohort 

The spring 2025 Champions Cohort will run from **April 9th, 2025 to June 4th, 2025**.

### Testimony from the 2023 Champions Cohort

The [fall 2023 Champions Cohort](https://openscapes.github.io/2023-fred-hutch/) included the the Berger Lab, Setty Lab, and Ha Lab. A recap of some of the work these teams accomplished is on the [Openscapes blog](https://openscapes.org/blog/2023-12-04-fred-hutch/).
