Our group offers various types of data oriented support to the Fred Hutch data community.  We aim to foster a vibrant data science community at Fred Hutch, promoting democratized access to expertise, collaboration, and mentorship. We encourage a culture of transparency, collaboration, open documentation, and sharing to maximize resources and ensure stakeholders can effectively use the provided resources. By investing in comprehensive training programs, they equip researchers with the necessary skills to navigate complex data landscapes. Offering in-person and online courses, workshops, and documentation, the team empowers the Fred Hutch community with essential data science skills to drive impactful advancements in healthcare.



Our collaborative data science training group creates a variety of data science training resources including live classes at Fred Hutch, trainer-lead learning communities and online resources.  You can find links to our [training resources on our Training page.](https://hutchdatascience.org/training/)


## Community-Based Training

Training at the Data Science Lab consists of more than courses and workshops. We learn best when we learn with others, so we provide social opportunities to learn together. There are opportunities to Learn Skills through courses, to Experience skills in Learning Communities, and to practice our skills together with codeathons.

Please note that all courses, workshops, and learning community sessions adhere to our event [participation guidelines](pages/participation.qmd). 



## Self Directed Training

We also offer self directed material in the form of guides and documentation for computational and data oriented topics in the [SciWiki](programs/sciwiki.qmd).
