The Office of the CDO staff support a variety of staff-oriented supports, resources and tools.  We share those resources as broadly as possible as the tools and education needs of data-users at Fred Hutch are shared by others working in the biomedical data space. 

**We do this outreach and sharing via what we call the Data Science Lab (this site) and it's affiliates (the [hutchdatascience.org](https://hutchdatascience.org/) site). We also support Fred Hutch in both overall [Data Strategy](strategy.qmd) as well as advancing [Data Partnerships](partnerships.qmd).  **

# Data Culture

“Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” In our group we believe that a strong, inclusive culture is essential to achieving our mission. Our core values and community event guidelines reflect this commitment, fostering an environment where respect, curiosity, and collaboration drive innovation. Through shared principles and open participation, we create a space where every voice contributes to advancing healthcare and research.
