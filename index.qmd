[Fred Hutch's](https://www.fredhutch.org/en.html) merger to form a hybrid clinical care and research institute in 2022 joins a diversity of focus, skills, interests and capabilities that can spur innovation. To support this, the **Office of the Chief Data Officer, (OCDO)** works to create a robust and coordinated data ecosystem at Fred Hutch via a few mechanisms:  

- [Data Strategy](strategy.qmd)
- [Data Governance](gov.qmd)
- [Translational Data Science](dss.qmd)
- [Human Computer Interaction](programs/wildscp.qmd)
- [Translational Applications & Tools](tools.qmd)
- [Training & Community](https://ocdo.fredhutch.org/dasl)
- [Data Partnerships](partnerships.qmd)

The mission of our group is to ensure an effective data ecosystem at Fred Hutch by developing a modern, well documented, well implemented, overall data strategy that evolves with the needs and capabilities of those leveraging data regardless of “where they live” from the clinic to the research groups.
